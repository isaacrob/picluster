This is the stuff that goes into an IPython profile to controll my drone cluster, which is driven by the stuff in distdrone.
Create an IPython cluster and replace its inner stuff with this.
Have the ip addresses of the remote Raspberry Pis saved in the file called ipaddresses.
To configure to your setup, run writeremotehosts.py. Specify the controller's ip with --controller_ip=(the ip).
The configuration given in all the files is for my particular setup.
