This is the stuff that goes into an IPython profile to controll my drone cluster, which is driven by the stuff in distdrone.
To work this, change the ip address of the controller.py file to that of your controller and launch with ipcluster start --profile=picluster after creating a profile called picluster and replacing it with this.
Have the ip addresses of the remote Raspberry Pis saved in the file called ipaddresses.
The configuration given in all the files is for my particular setup.
